Driving around town looking for the best spot for the
(Drunk and hot girls)
Up in the club look at here what we got some
(Drunk and hot girls)
Stop dancing with your girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talking about your boyfriend since he is not me
Stop running up my tab cause these drinks is not free
You drunk and hot girl

We go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
We go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

I don't wanna drop your friends off, I just want you
(You drunk and hot girl)
You wanna sit down but we hit the drive through
(You drunk and hot girl)

Please don't throw up in the car we almost crash
Oh now you sober, how'd I know you'd say that

Lot of dangerous necessity that people seek without regard
To where they are, the human heart is curious above all things,
laa the lights are low
your eyes are bright
the music, makes it sweet delight
It's out inside, I'm feeling right
your dress is tight
Oh waaaa ow, I want you right now

Don't tell me you sing,you bout to get a deal
(You drunk and hot girls)
Aaa aaa aa aa aa, that's how the fuck you sound
(You drunk and hot girl)
You only live once do whatever you like
I thought I'd be with you for only one night
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
That drunk and hot girl

We go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
(A little sippy sippy)
We gonna through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
(Want a little whisky)

(We go- through too- much bullshit- to mess- mess with- these drunk-
all of these drunk and hot girls)
